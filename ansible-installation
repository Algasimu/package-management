ANSIBLE FILE STRUCTURE

The default ansible home directory is /etc/ansible
This directory will consist of: a) ansible.cfg b) hosts c) roles

DEFAULT ANSIBLE CONFIGURATION FILE

The default location is: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, in which we can make various settings like location of inventory file, host_key_checking as False
But we can define ansible configuration file in different location and for this there is a priority for this files.

LOCATON WITH PRIORITY [starting from top to bottom]

- ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable
- ./ansible.cfg from the current directory
- ~/.ansible.cfg file present in home directory
- /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg default ansible.cfg file.

HOST KEY CHECKING

Anytime you make an ssh connection with a server for the first time, you will be prompted to confirm if you want to continue making the connection.

This feature is by default set to true in the ansible.cfg file

Disable this by uncommenting the line in the configuration file

or

export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=false

CONFIGURING MANAGED NODES

Launch/select required no of servers (managed nodes)
Ansible Engine uses SSH Connection to connect and work with Manage nodes.
We can create SSH Connection in two ways: a) Password Authentication b) Password-less Authentication(This is with SSHï¿½Keys)
Provide the managed Nodes IP/FQDN in inventory file on Ansible Engine.
Test the connectivity by running:

        $ ansible all -m ping

PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION

Create same user(ansible) across all servers and provide password for all users.

      $ sudo adduser ansible

Provide root privileges to all ansible users on all servers.

      $ echo "ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ansible

Make sure that PasswordAuthentication is enabled to yes in all servers under /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
Restart the sshd service

      $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service

Test connectivity by providing a -k option to be prompted to enter the SSH password.

      $ ansible all -m ping -k

By default, Ansible tries to connect to the nodes as a remote user with the same name as your current system user, using its corresponding SSH keypair.

To connect as a different remote user, append the command with the -u flag and the name of the intended user:

      $ ansible all -m ping -u sammy

If the remote user has a password, use -k option to be prompted to enter the SSH password.

     $ ansible all -m ping -u sammy -k

HOST AND GROUP VARIABLES

If were run the ping command on all servers, we will get permission denied on the servers that need a password to authenticate.
instead of that, we can provide the password in the host file
This is at a host level or host level variable.

**Host variables**
[db]
172.31.13.31  ansible_ssh_pass=ansible
You can also connect using a different user by specifying the user in the hosts file.

[db]
172.31.13.31  ansible_ssh_user=sammy ansible_ssh_pass=abc123
Create a file on the managed nodes to see which user its working with.

    $ ansible all -m file -a "path=test.txt state=touch"

**Group variables:**
[db:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=sammy
ansible_ssh_pass=abc123
If variables are defined at a host level, then those variables will have 
precedence over variables that are defined at a group level.

PASSWORD-LESS AUTHENTICATION

Generate ssh-keys using ssh-keygen command from ansible user in the control machine.
Copy ssh public key using ssh-copy-id from /home/ansible/.ssh/ location.
Now login to remote server without providing password with the following command:

     $ ssh user_name@hostname

Now we can test connection from Ansible Engine to Managed Node using:

     $ ansible all -m ping
